Zoeys dotfiles for NixOS.
I use KDE Plasma 6 on NixOS. This is very focused on being for gaming, with all the different launchers I need, plus extras like mnagohud/goverlay for checking performance and Wine. There are some packages for C# and Unity Game Development.

Everything in the nixos-dotfiles can be copied over to /etc/nixos.
The files in config (for configuring mangohud, hyfetch etc) can go into ~/.config. 

TODO:
- Get C# and Unity extensions working in VS-Code (Neither flatpak or nix pkg vscode work) 
Meow :3
